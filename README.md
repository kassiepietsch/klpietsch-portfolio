## project goal
The goal of this project was to create an engaging portfolio website the encapsulates the skills and experience of the professional career so far. To do so I created an html application that uses flask as a launching platform. This is done so in the app.py file that specifies the pages and procedures. This portfolio impliments many skills learned in my digital product management class that I was able to condence into one website.

## web pages
I created a series of webpages with engaging and interactive contect to see my ecperience, resume, and information post graduation. There are links to social media accounts that users can connect with me, as well as contact information to reach out with any questions or opportunities.
